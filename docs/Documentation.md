## _**Definition of your audience**_
People who want a visual of their eating habits and an easy way to track meals. Health & fitness category. But the slideshow says Teachers, Mentors, Peers, Career Coaches, Recruiters, Hiring Managers.

## _**Definition statement ("i want to create a web app that...")**_
I want to create a web app that allows you to take photos of your meals instead of writing everything out like other apps. You can type out the calories but you don't have to. If you do, it calculates the total at the bottom. The photos you take are in a grid and you can set the number of meals you have. It lets you see everything you ate that day.

You can mark a day as good/bad, so in the calendar view you can see how you did overall that month. 

It may have a weight tracking feature in the future.

## _**High level story (elevator pitch)**_
It's a food diary that lets you see all of your meals at a glance. It uses pictures instead of just text; all you have to type is the calories. It's an easy and lazy way to keep track of eating habits and visually see how you do on your diet overall.

## _**Outline of the content**_
### _Camera Page_
* The user will mostly be opening the app just to quickly add another meal, so the camera is the first thing that opens. After a photo is taken, the number keyboard comes up and the user can type the calories. 

* The user finishes this step by pressing a âœ“. The user can also be like nevermind and press an X to go to Grid View or just close the app.

* I think there should be an option to import a photo too.


### _Main Page / Grid View (I call it that in my head)_
* The main part of this page is the grid of photos. The photo the user just took appears in the first available square. The time the photo was taken and the calorie count is displayed in the corners of the photo. 

* There is a calorie total at the bottom of the page. 

* As the user adds more photos, they appear on the grid and the calorie total updates. When on the Grid View/Main Page, the user can swipe left or right to look at a different day. 

* This page also has links in the corner to open the Calendar or go to Settings. Also a + sign to add another photo (go to the Camera page).

* At the bottom of the page there is a question, "Did you meet your goal today?" The user selects green for yes and red for no. I'm not sure if that's the best way to track good/bad days yet.



### _Editing Page / Individual Photo View_
* If the user wants to retake an image, delete a photo/entry, change the time, or change the calories, they can do so by tapping on a photo. This takes the user to the Editing Page.

### _Calendar_
* When a user marks a day as good or bad, the green or red days show on the Calendar. This gives the user a visual of how they did overall that month. The user can swipe to check previous months or tap to view their food on a specific date.


### _Settings_
* Background color & color settings
* Number of meals? 
* Body measurements / goals? (might add this feature later on along with weight tracking)
* About. I think you're supposed to have an About, right?
