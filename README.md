## _**Target audience**_
People who want a visual of their eating habits and an easy way to track meals.

## _**Why?**_
If you have ever tried to go on a diet you know how frustrating it can be to track your calories and even moreso keep up with it over an extended period of time. This app is taking something that's tedious and making it more visually appealing and easier to use. If you have to stop and take a picture it would make you more mindful of what you're about to eat. It's a visual reminder of how you use your calories.

## _**Outline of the content**_
#### I wrote this a long time ago and it's no longer entirely accurate. I'll update it soon!
#### Camera Page
* The user will mostly be opening the app just to quickly add another meal, so the camera is the first thing that opens. After a photo is taken, the number keyboard comes up and the user can type the calories.

* The user finishes this step by pressing a âœ“. The user can also be like nevermind and press an X to go to back to the main page.

* I think there should be an option to import a photo too.


#### Main Page / Grid View (I call it that in my head)
* The main part of this page is the grid of photos. The photo the user just took appears in the first available square. The time the photo was taken and the calorie count is displayed in the corners of the photo.

* There is a calorie total at the bottom of the page.

* As the user adds more photos, they appear on the grid and the calorie total updates. When on the Grid View/Main Page, the user can swipe left or right to look at a different day.

* This page also has links in the corner to open the Calendar or go to Settings. Also a + sign to add another photo (go to the Camera page).

* At the bottom of the page there is a question, "Did you meet your goal today?" The user selects green for yes and red for no.



#### Editing Page / Individual Photo View
* If the user wants to retake an image, delete a photo/entry, change the time, or change the calories, they can do so by tapping on a photo. This takes the user to the Editing Page.

#### Calendar
* I'm most excited about adding this feature next.
* When a user marks a day as good or bad, the green or red days show on the Calendar. This gives the user a visual of how they did overall that month. The user can swipe to check previous months or tap to view their food on a specific date.

#### Settings
* User login
* Body measurements / goals? (might add this feature later on along with weight tracking)
